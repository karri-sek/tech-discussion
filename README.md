# Tech Challenge - Cart

There are two folders here:

Backend - An Express API

Frontend - A React Application

At the moment they have basic functionality in that you can browse the various products on the store.

## Base Task
Both folders have a readme which has information regarding the main task, titled `Base Requirement`. Deliver this for both frontend and backend.

## Secondary Feature (Optional)
Each readme also offers an additional item titled: `Secondary Feature (Optional)` - you can choose to do either feature. The backend feature will require some small changes to frontend but mostly focus on business logic. The frontend feature will require some small changes to backend but mostly focus on the user interface and behaviours. 

Choose whichever task you feel will best express your skillset. You are not required to do either. If you are a fullstack developer, and wish to, you're welcome to do both.

## Delivery 
You should put this code into your own git repository and complete this challenge there. Please avoid using the company name or any identifiable information in your code. Provide a link to the git repository when you are finished.
